Collection of codes in Matlab(R) and C++ for solving basic problems presented and discussed in the "Computational Fluid Dynamics of Reactive Flows" course (Politecnico di Milano)

## 1. Advection-diffusion equation in 1D with the Finite Difference (FD) method
The advection-diffusion equation is solved on a 1D domain using the finite-difference method. Constant, uniform velocity and diffusion coefficients are assumed. The forward (or explicit) Euler method is adopted for the time discretization, while spatial derivatives are discretized using 2nd-order, centered schemes.

## 3. Poisson equation in 2D
The Poisson equation is solved on a 2D rectangular domain using the finite-difference method. A constant source term is initially adopted. Spatial derivatives are discretized using 2nd-order, centered schemes.
